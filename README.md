## CI/CD

The pipeline is configured for [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) using GitLab veriables for security.
The pipeline has 4 stages:

- build
- test
- build_image
- sonar

The build builds the application and if it does not fail goes to the next stage - runs all tests. If it passes it builds a docker image from the Dockerfile and pushes it to Docker Hub. The last stage is the SonarQube code analysis which gives statistics for the code quality (found on http://localhost:9000).
